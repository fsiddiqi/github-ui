Americas,Body Composition,"BCT is a validated smartphone-based solution that digitally measures body circumference and fat composition in the privacy of the home and assesses these markers for chronic disease risk in support of insurance and healthcare industries. We enable people and organizations to quickly, privately and non-invasively identify and monitor populations with diabetes and pre-diabetes risk and other chronic disease risk and guide them towards improved outcomes. In the context of Covid-19, we capture the markers of underlying chronic conditions that typically go undiagnosed and leave people vulnerable. This is a key driver and engagement point in an individual’s health journey, especially since outdated measurements such as BMI are poor indicators of metabolic health and typically lead to risk misclassification. BCT can easily be integrated into an insurer’s digital platform and support underwriting and health engagement while guiding policyholders towards improved outcomes (and reduced claims).
An individual is guided through our application’s user friendly image capturing process which involves taking a front and side image using his/her smartphone. The photos are processed  and evaluated using advanced statistical methods, computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence, after which they are deleted. No identifiable information ever leaves the phone during the 30 second process.  The app then returns an avatar to the user with accurate waist, hip, chest and thigh circumference measurements, total body fat percentage, hip to waist ratio, height to waist ratio, and then assessess these variables for an individual’s chronic disease risk using WHO and IDF published guidelines. 
BCT’s application provides the insurer with regular, accurate, and objective measures of an individual’s chronic disease risk in 30 seconds within the privacy of their home supporting several use cases including digital underwriting, health management, policyholder engagement, onboarding and retention, and claim reduction.","Re-insurance - Underwriting, P&C - Claims Prevention, L&W - Claims Prevention, Underwriting","L&W, P&C, Reinsurance",,Advisory,1-Early Stage,,"Identified, NDA Executed, Commercials in-progess",,Storyboard,bct.webp,https://www.bodycomposition.tech/,,,,"Accurate Body Circumference app, Digital Underwriting app, Accurate Body Fat, Body measurements app, Body composition technology, Chronic Disease Risk Assessment, Diabetes screening, Health management, Wellness app, Healthcare app",,S.Ponnuswamy,11/24/19,11/26/19,5/6/20,

Americas,Franco Signor,"Solving The MSP Compliance Puzzle With Franco Signor

Franco Signor delivers innovative Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) compliance solutions based on unparalleled expertise and decades of industry experience. We are the fastest growing MSP compliance firm in the U.S., leading the industry in the development of new products and services.

Our proprietary processes deliver best in class service to our clients with measurably superior results. Franco Signor’s technology-driven products and services, like our Compliance 360° program, have revolutionized MSP compliance—and we’re not slowing down.

Why choose Franco Signor?

Experience. Founded by recognized MSP visionaries.
Technology. Our solutions put your Medicare data to work.
Partnership. We understand your unique compliance needs.
Engagement. Unparalleled legislative and regulatory involvement.
Comprehensive. True MSP compliance goes beyond Medicare Set Asides.
Compliance 360 Completes the MSP PUzzle

CMS has all the pieces for every Medicare claim. Franco Signor thinks you should, too.

Our Compliance 360° Program has simplified every step of the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) compliance process for the client and front-line adjuster. We’ve combined Medicare Reporting, Conditional Payments and Medicare Set Asides (MSAs) into one comprehensive compliance solution. Our program provides our clients with the completed compliance puzzle.

Conditional Payments, MSAs, and Medicare Reporting programs all developed independently and with little coordination between them, resulting in silos of information. CMS compiles information from each silo, assembling these pieces for every claim.

The Compliance 360° Program duplicates CMS integration with Franco Signor’s proprietary technology platform. We’ve cut out the manual processes and replaced them with triggers and alerts that can be easily updated based on changing CMS policy. That means our clients can settle and close claims efficiently and with confidence.",,,,,,,"Identified, NDA Executed, Commercials complete, Marketplace content",,,francosignor.png,https://francosignor.com/,,,,,,J.

DXC Assure Digital Insurance uses Surfly for:

Support Teams

Addressing customers’ needs over the phone or chat can often be tricky in the light of lurking misinterpretations, especially when trying to guide them through, say, our website. Hence, the pressing need to create a bond of trust between agents to bridge gaps with customers was felt. Surfly solutioned this need by creating an in-person experience with customers by connecting with them seamlessly. Just launching a Surfly session enables the support team agent to instantly see the customer issues or illustrate a concept without a hitch. Quick and simple!

Sales Teams

Technology enabled quality sales presentations to ensure increased sales revenue over the foundation of ever stronger relationships is a universal need in today’s dynamic and competitive business environment. This necessitates connecting with prospects one-on-one for delivering quality sales pitches. Surfly addresses this by offering a full featured co-browsing solution to facilitate working remotely and collaborating with prospects, thus, equipping sales teams with tools for every sales scenario. Closing of sale has never been so easy.

Advisors

Very often, keeping customers satisfied and explaining product offerings to prospects can be tricky. The conventional modes of communication – emails and telephones for contacting customers and prospects, often fall short in their ability to accord them with an out-of-the-box and timely response or personalized experience. Co-browsing with Surfly helps transforms the advisors’ interactions with customers by remotely addressing customers’ needs quickly and effectively thereby shortening the sales cycle by 50 percent or more.

How to setup

Surfly works on any website without configuration or changes needed to the website itself. With our API, integrating co-browsing in your own application is as simple as loading an URL in a certain iframe.

Americas,Xybion,"COVID-19 Pandemic Has changed the way Employers and Insurers will have to manage workplace health, safety, compliance and risk.

As we grapple with the immediate health and economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic it’s longer term impacts on business risks and challenges for employers, employees and insurance carriers are just beginning to come into focus. Earlier this month, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration declared that coronavirus was a recordable injury—meaning an employer would have to notify the federal safety agency when a worker caught the disease at work—and issued guidance to that effect.

Ongoing and Emerging Customer Needs No matter what rules and guidance may emerge one thing is very clear- employers, employees and insurance companies will have to implement new ways of working in the post Covid-19 world.

Employers need to be able to proactively and more stringently capture early health safety indicators, validate and document all incidents and health & safety Claims
Establish, implement and manage a safe workplace for all employees
Provide employees with an easy way to report and document their workplace health, safety, contacts and medical care information.
Validate all exposures and other industrial hygiene issues
Implement full monitoring and compliance with all existing and evolving regulations and guidelines
Insurance carriers may require evidence of employer’s processes and policies in place for management of safe workplace before underwriting insurance policies.
May require proof of ongoing compliance with government mandates and the insurance company approved process requirements
Premiums and claims payment may be impacted by documented evidence of compliance with safe workplace requirements
